# Theta Tau Happiness Maximization

This is a program to quickly and accurately match Bigs and Littles according to their stated preferences and general personalities. Read below for general setup, usage, assumptions about input, and the algorithms behind it. Made for Fall '19 Pledge Project.     

## Assumptions

We assume our input to be 3 CSV files: `weights.csv`, `big-rankings.csv`, and `little-rankings.csv`.     
The `*-rankings` files include a given person's top 3 rankings for a potential Big/Little
Here are the contents we require in each (all cells are 0 indexed):     
     
`weights.csv`: Weights of each possible connection. Rows represent the choices of the Bigs, Columns represent those of the Littles. For example, the value of the cell at (2, 1) represents the weight for a Big ranking a Little as 3rd and a Little ranking that Big as 2nd.     

here is an example:     ![weights picture](/misc/weights.png)

`big-rankings.csv`: Preferences of bigs. Rows represent
